# Let's Build a Compiler X A Compiler From Scratch

## Introduction 

The purpose of this project is to build a simple
compiler by combining techniques shown in the video
[A Compiler From Scratch](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/a-compiler-from-scratch) 
created by Gary Bernhardt with the series [Let's Build a Compiler](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/) by Jack Crenshaw. 

After watching and coding along with the video A Compiler From Scratch, I better understood what a compiler does. 
I have attempted Jack Crenshaw's series before but never got past the first few chapters. His series does
lexing, parsing, and code generation in a single pass. My plan is to break lexing, parsing, and code generation
into distinct phases. 

Another difference is that Let's Build A Compiler does things in a procedural approach, while I intend to use 
a more object oriented approach. I also intend to use automated testing to make verifying that my project
works at lot easier.
